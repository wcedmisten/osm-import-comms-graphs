Your use of addr:place is wrong. addr:place is to be used only in cases
where the housenumber does not refer to a street.  This may or may not
exist in Latvia but in the few instances I spot checked, addr:place
should have been addr:city.

Kind regards

Sarah

Thank you for the clarification! Updated everything as it makes sense to
use one tag for all types of settlements and description of the tag matches
the use case ("the name of the largest settlement (city / town / other)
that is included in the address"). At the same time, tags addr:town,
addr:village and addr:hamlet are used in OSM, but not all of them even have
a wiki page in English. Originally, addr:place was chosen for the bot to
avoid separate tags addr:village and addr:hamlet which also were not used
as much. Addr:city seemed to be misleading for some users due to its name
indicating city. If I started from scratch defining address tags for OSM, I
would use addr:place for all these cases as its name better indicates that
various types of settlements are included. For me, it doesn't seem logical
to define separate tag only for cases when there is no street as using the
same settlement tag when there is one seems fine. In Latvia, when there is
no street, addr:housename is used instead of addr:housenumber.

Please, do not try to redefine tags if you would define them differently in case
of you starting to create tag definitions without consulting others.
It results in things being broken in affected area for anyone using standard tag
definitions.
Please, roll back that changes and do them again with standard tag meanings.
If you want to redefine widely used tags used by many others please start from
asking others rather than breaking geocoding, address display and all that.

Not sure what you mean by redefining tags. I corrected a mistake in a tag
use that was pointed out earlier in this discussion. No existing tag
definitions (wiki) were altered to fit bot's purpose.

And addr:village doesn't have one.

Thanks for the link! addr:city could be a good candidate for that list too.

This is not a redefinition attempt. Just some thoughts that would have been
better to keep to myself.

In the State Address Register of Latvia, both numbers and names are within
one field. In address notations, when there is no street, all numbers and
names are put in double quotes as per Articel 43.1. of the Regulation of
the Cabinet of Ministers No. 455 of June 29, 2021
<https://likumi.lv/ta/id/324387#p43>. Also note that in Article 40
<https://likumi.lv/ta/id/324387#p40> on address notation in small villages
without streets, no housenumbers are mentioned, only housenames. Thus, in
Latvia, it makes sense to use addr:housename for all cases when there is no
street. E.g.:
https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/867801167 (name),
https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/1001090030 (name consisting of name and
number),
https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/237853362 (number in a village),
https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/9888037895 (number in a small village
without streets).

Even such cases exist when housename might look a streetname + housenumber
for an inexperienced user (trying to separate it would create an erroneous
address):

Read my previous answers and rethink again your ideas about rolling back.

Unfortunately, you have now broken the addresses which do not have a
street. These are the ones were you need addr:place.

Should be:

  addr:housenumber=1

This is just from looking at the data as is. Somebody with local
knowledge might have further insides. And that's exactly, why we require
imports being discussed before they are made. So that these issues can
be spotted before the data gets into the database.

When you point to such a fact, I was able to find at Key:addr:place
<https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:addr:place> that "it is okay to
have both addr:place=* and addr:city=* with the same value on the same
object". Will fix it. At the same time, there is nothing written about it
at Key:addr:city <https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:addr:city>,
although there should be.

No, in Latvia, housenames are not further separated in parts but treated as
a whole. Per legislation. In full address notation, this would be
"Salenieki 48", Salaspils pag., Salaspils nov., LV-2118.

Although it looks like a number, it's a housename in the State Address
Register. In full address notation, all housenames are put in double
quotes. This one would be "1", Feima?i, Feima?u pag., R?zeknes nov.,
LV-4623.

Add:place will be added additionally as mentioned before. Otherwise,
although it looks like a number, it's a housename in the State Address
Register. In full address notation, all housenames are put in double
quotes. This one would be "1", T?mu?i, V?r?mu pag., R?zeknes nov., LV-4647.

No, in Latvia, housenames are not further separated in parts but treated as
a whole. Per legislation. In full address notation, this would be
"R?gas-Siguldas ?oseja 3A k-1", Ber?i, Garkalnes pag., Ropa?u nov., LV-1024.

As a person with a local knowledge, I'm explaining that tags should also
follow local legislation instead of making up alternative addressing system
leading to unexpected results.

I strongly recommend that you describe the exact changes you want to do
before you do any further uploads to the database. The public database
is not a playground for yo to toy around with until you get it right.

addr:place and addr:city may appear together when they refer to
different places which both would appear in the postal address. Do not
duplicate them when they refer to the same place or datausers will
interpret the address wrong.

The format used by the legislation is only marginally relevant in this
discussion. The more important part is to get the format right, so OSM
data users can interpret the address. If you leave the address as is
with jus the addr:housename and no addr:street or addr:place, then the
address will per convention be interpreted as a street address, i.e.
addr:street will be derived from the nearest street. You'll see that
when searching for the address:

There is a common misconception that an import source is wisely
structured just because it is 'official'. It is not.
Official database were made by humans, too. Somebody came up with a
database schema on their desk based on the couple of examples they were
familiar with. And then they hit reality, which didn't fit the neat
schema at all. So they stuffed the data into the database anyways as best
as it's possible without changing the schema and then put a complicated
'legislation' on top to explain away the errors. There is no need to
copy the errors 1:1 into OSM. We are in the fortunate position that we
can change our schema when reality doesn't fit our preconceptions.
This is how addr:place came to be. We started out with the assumption
that every address has a street. When we found out that this is wrong,
we adapted the schema instead of reassigning addr:housenumber a new
function.

In this address the "1" smells like a house number, looks like a house number,
behaves like a house number, so addr:housenumber it should be. Not doing so
will give you the strangest misbehaviour when the data is used.
For example, as long as you insist on using addr:housename this address can only
be found with '1 Feima?i, Latvia' but not with 'Feima?i 1, Latvia'.
That is not a bug, it is a feature.

As I understand you started to used addr:place for cases where
there is street-indexed housenumber and no place-indexed housenumber
and it is not a conscription number.

Also, it seems that your bot is using add:housename for numeric values
that almost certainly are addr:housenumber

No. addr:housename is for house names (in this case tag is well named).
It is not for house numbers in any case at all.
Even if internal State Address Register of Latvia does not distinguish between names
and numbers, that does not change that OSM distinguishes between them.

For example https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/237853362 and
https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/9888037895 have addr:housename=1is at least extremely suspicious.

And if you mention that "both numbers and names are within one field" then it needs
to split into proper fields during import.

Rather than assume that OSM tagging follows Latvian legislation and 
redefining addr:housename to "house names and whatever
is stored in Latvian state databases in the same field as house names".

> Read my previous answers and rethink again your ideas about rolling back.
>
I am still pretty sure that addr:housename=1 is a clear tagging mistake.

"In the State Address Register of Latvia, both numbers and names are within one field"
does not mean that they should or can be stored in the same OSM tag.

(I would be more likely to classify it as "weird local traditions" if that would be discussed
before edit and actually planned, now it looks like "it is feature not a bug")
(I am not planning to make any rollbacks personally, but I expect that it will continue
to break processing of OSM data in Latvia and sooner or later it will be fixed)

Then why does the wiki state that "it is okay to have both addr:place=* and
addr:city=* *with the same value on the same object*"? It's rather
impossible to do things right when wiki says one thing, but some other user
says the opposite.

For this particular address, the upper object is rural territory
("Salaspils pag."), not a village or any other settlement. Although
Salenieki looks like a village, interpreting it as such in context of an
address would be wrong. Or should addr:place contain the value of
addr:subdistrict ("Salaspils pagasts")? Then such an assumption I would
like to see documented in wiki. Probably in such cases Nominatim should be
improved not to add the nearest road and a bunch of nearest settlements
(all of "C11, V?cu Kalni, Augstkalni, Salenieki" are erroneously added) in
Latvia? Since address data is being updated with the bot, all necessary
data to create an address notation, are within addr.* tags (except
country), so there is no need to add anything else from other objects
(street names, settlements etc.) in Latvia. Seems that country specific
configuration exists (
https://github.com/osm-search/Nominatim/blob/master/settings/address-levels.json).
Ideally, results should match the address notation in the State Address
Register (e.g., when searching for an address at kadastrs.lv
<https://www.kadastrs.lv/> (National Address Register > Search address) or
BalticMaps <https://balticmaps.eu/en/> (the latter visually excludes
postcodes from search results and housenames aren't quoted)).

It's OK not to be found with "Feima?i 1, Latvia" because village comes
after housename or streetname+housenumber. "Feima?i 1" would mean either
housename, or name of village/town/city, none of which exist. Btw, if
country isn't added, it's found even with "Feima?i 1".
Interpreting on top of local legislation is necessary because it's used
outside OSM. If somebody wants to find an address in OSM, he expects it to
follow rules used elsewhere. Otherwise he might not be able to find an
address.
Technically, it's not hard to separate housenames that look like numbers
(also with letters etc., e.g., 1A, 1/3) into addr:housenumber. As Mateusz
also pointed out, I'll change it as it doesn't complicate the ability to
construct proper address notation much and even in legislation it's called
number in some (but not all) places as it looks like one (Articel 43.1.
<https://likumi.lv/ta/id/324387#p43>).

OK, different usage than documented in wiki. Yes, it was for all cases when
an address was located within a village, either as a housenumber assigned
to a street, or as a housename without a street. I changed addr:place to
addr:city in all cases, but it might be that addr:place should have been
retained for housenames without a street. Also, it's not clear in these
cases, if addr:city can be retained, or not (wiki says it can be, but Sarah
wrote the opposite).

OK, I'll separate housenames that look like numbers (also with letters
etc., e.g., 1A, 1/3) into addr:housenumber as it doesn't complicate the
ability to construct proper address notation much and even in legislation
it's called number in some (but not all) places as it looks like one (Articel

It is entirely normal to discover during such discussion that OSM Wiki had confusing/
badly worded/misleading descriptions.

Sometimes updating or extending OSM Wiki documentation takes large part of such
effort (it happened to me few times when I was adding new functionality).

Self-contradictory description at OSM Wiki is one of reasons why discussing very 
large edits before doing them is a good idea.

And yes, https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:addr:place would benefit from clarifying
what is claimed there.

Changes regarding usage of addr:housename and addr:housenumber have been
applied - if house name looks like a number, it's tagged as
addr:housenumber and vice versa.

Hello,

I work for a company based near Sondrio, Italy, active in the cartography 
industry.

In the recent years, we have managed the street directories and the house 
numbers for some Municipalities, in the Province of Sondrio, Como and 
Lecco. 

Because of new legal requirements, we also have made a new design of the 
street directory and of the house numbers for several Municipalities, 
usually using the metric numbering method (see a detailed explanation in 
the wiki).

House numbers were surveyed directly by us in the field. All data is 
georeferenced with a high degree of accuracy. 

When transitioning from the old to the new numbering scheme, one of the 
greatest difficulties for delivery operators, emergency operators, postal 
services and people in general is that they cannot no longer move around 
these zones easily because their sat nav or their apps (especially Google 
Maps) are not yet updated. This gap remains for several years, despite 
having tried to contact these companies, with the willingness to provide 
them the data.

Knowing OpenStreetMap too, last year we imported the house numbers for 
Montagna in Valtellina in OSM (Import/Catalogue/Montagna in Valtellina 
House Numbers Import - OpenStreetMap Wiki) as a way to provide the 
aforementioned users with a tool for searching and locating an address. 

This work has attracted a lot of interest from other Municipalities.

Therefore we'd like to import other house numbers in the near future, 
starting with the nonurban part of the Municipality of Sondrio, where a 
street directory did not exist. The municipality of Sondrio has already 
approved to distribute the data with a license compatible with the one 
used in OSM.

This proposal has already been discussed in the Italian and Lombard 
mailing list (Lombardy is the region where Sondrio is located), where no 
one showed objections.

More info about this proposal can be found on the wiki:
https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Catalogue/Sondrio_House_Numbers_Street_Import

The data format and the plan are much alike the previous import, so we 
don't expect to find any relevant issue.

Best regards,

Stefano

I didn't find the changeset for the previous import but
type=import is not a good pratice (type is used to describe a relation), 
the more common tag is import=yes
and also a good changeset comment, for ex the same as the subjet

Hi.

I recommend to forgo the import tag in the changeset. if you're using your import account, and mention the import in the changeset comment, it's already implied that it's an import.

I have looked at the import plan how you intend to merge existing addresses
and found this sentence: "In Italy, address data must be placed exclusively
on nodes because the housenumber identifies the external access that leads
from the street to the housing units (houses, stores, offices, etc).
Therefore addresses placed on buildings will be removed."


Please note that in OSM, the tag "addr:housenumber" is not only used for
housenumbers (feature on its own), but also for the housenumber as part of
an address (property of something), therefore I do not believe it is
acceptable to remove these housenumbers when they are on a feature.


Cheers,

Martin

what is the added value of not following the import guideline?
if you use osmcha or any other changeset tracking tool,
it is easy to act according to the presence or not of an import=yes tag
to say that it is useless when the account is dedicated doesn't make 
sense. you could also say that the description is not necessary when 
there is a link to the wiki or that no changeset tag is necessary if the 
account has a description of the import... well no, that's not the good 
practices included in the guideline imports

where does it say to do this in the guidelines? changeset tagging seems extremely ambiguous to me. this import uses url=* whereas imports I've conducted use website=* in the changest tags to link the wiki.

I don't see any guidance to use a tag like this.

if you're trying to track this import through a validation tool, why not just use another tag that is uniform to all changesets in the import?

Thanks for response, I try to answer the various questions

I've seen many import projects in Italy used the type=import tag in the 
past, so we used the same.

Anyway I have no problem in using import=yes instead, but I really would 
like evidence that it is used by some major QA tools, otherwise the use of 
another tag does not provide any gain.

This is just so obvious we didn't specify it in the wiki page ;-)

This topic has been discussed with you several times. In Italy, a 
housenumber is "a unique number that identifies an external access that 
from the road leads directly or indirectly to houses, shops, offices, 
garages, etc". It's not a rule of OSM or an opinion, it's something that 
derives from country legislation. I understand it's different from several 
other countries, but we should take it for granted and consider it also 
necessary e.g. an housenumber tag on a building outline will never 
accommodate a building that has several entrances with different numbers, 
as happens very frequently.

The wiki page was amended to make clear that the import data is only 
related to the hamlets in the municipal area and not the main city. 

Your examples are out of scope of this import because they are in Sondrio 
and not in a hamlet. Even though they are clearly wrongly tagged.

It seems to me the only building affected is the following one:
https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/267833740

Please also note that not only it is wrong that this building has an 
address, but the address is also outdated.

Stefano and support team

it doesn?t matter, people use addresses like in most places in europe, street, housenumber, postcode, city. Many features have addresses tagged, it is useful information, particularly in Italy because in Italy housenumbers refer to points and you cannot infer them for businesses and  other features, as you could with polygons.

    Since it is being debated all the time this should be considered an
open question even though current documentation states that addresses
on areas are to be avoided at all costs. The Italian legislation on
housembers does not meet the requirements in OSM, where addresses also
apply to POIs like shops, which can be mapped as areas. There is some
movement on this issue, such as the initiative to promote the Bremen
schema, but it is an evolving subject. I feel the need to ask not to
take advantage imports to do that. That said?

    That?s okay for me because this item doesn't carry POI information.

    In this regard I suggest to adopt old_addr: instead of was:addr: for
obsolete addresses:

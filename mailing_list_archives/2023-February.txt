Hi All,

This is a copy of the email I sent to talk-au.

I'm relatively new at OSM and wanted to map the bike racks in Brisbane (AU), of which I am a resident. A few members on the osm discord graciously pointed out the CBD data is available at https://www.data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/data/dataset/bicycle-racks, is under CC BY 4.0, and there is a waiver to OSM https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/File:BCC_OSM_Waiver_-_Signed_30Aug2018.pdf. I have read the import guidelines, and I'm prepared to spend a lot of time making sure there are no duplicates and making sure the locations match up with the map.

Does anyone have anything they'd like to add, any advice, or any reasons I shouldn't go ahead with this?

Thanks,
James

For start, try to map some of this bike racks.

In my city such data was good enough to identify locations where bicycle parkings
were missing in OSM but utterly useless for direct mapping due to errors in placement 
reaching up to 500m.

(if you have programming background I can dig out my script that I used for visualising
conflicts between city data and OSM data, and script that I used to apply long list of errata
to city data)

starting a import when you describe yourself as "relatively new"
is maybe not a good idea.

it would be better to do the first additions classically, find out how 
to deal with highway=* to divide, errors in existing data, poor location 
in opendata, ...

if you still want to do an import, you have probably read that
the guideline asks you to make a wiki page describing your project

Marc

Hi James,

You mentioned that you were discussing this on the discord, so I went hunting for your messages and found your wiki page

https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Catalogue/Brisbane_City_Council_CBD_Bike_Rack_Import

I recommend linking this right away on the imports list because it helps others find more information about your import.

My thoughts on the import so far:

You should make a table for which tags you are translating from the dataset to openstreetmap so its easier to read.

Additionally, I recommend not using the source=* and source:date=* tags on the objects, you should put them in the changeset instead of on the objects.

The wiki page also seems a little half-baked, I'd like to see a little more work done describing your project before you get started.

Since there are only ~100 bike parkings in the dataset, all in our CBD, I plan to check them all in person at the end of the import. The main reason I'm doing this is to get more experience with imports and josm. I have already added a few bike parking spots manually outside the CBD. Does this still seem worrying to you? 

Also, I'm not sure what you mean by highway=* with respect to bike parking.

Please do not import inaccurate data with the intent of fixing it 
later.? If you want to practice an import, correct your data first, then 
import it later.? Too often imported data sets with errors gets 
forgotten and then there is a bunch of poor data in the database.

I recommend surveying all the points and to correct all the external 
data, then importing, if you really want to practice importing.

No. That does not work. Many people had such plans and left import debris behind.

See top values of https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/fixme#values
for some examples:

https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/?key=fixme&value=Import%20CTR%20Veneto.%20Sostituire%20con%20building%3Dstable%20(stalla)%20o%20building%3Dbarn%20(fienile)#chronology

In such case, I am strongly against import and recommend avoiding it.

Either you can do such checks and they you can do and map things one by one
or fix data in dataset and import them in one go.

You can use test server for that, or just do everything except uploading the edit.

Yeah, you could run the upload on the test server, go do the in-person verification using the test server (I like GoMap) and then adjust as necessary and upload to the live server.

I am sorry, I think there has been some confusion. When I said "at the end of the import", I meant "in the final stages of the importing process", before I upload the data, to check the integrity.

Oh, that makes far more sense!

Sorry for jumping on you but it sounded exactly like "lets import known bad things and
fix it later" which is a common mistake that almost never goes well.

Subject: [Imports] Import proposal: Global ML Building Footprints for
 Nottinghamshire, UK
Message-ID: <PR3P191MB12165EB3168E1608680F77EBBCD59@PR3P191MB1216.EURP191.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hello,

I am interested in using Microsoft's "Global ML Building Footprints (https://github.com/microsoft/GlobalMLBuildingFootprints)" for import. It is a huge dataset, but I am interested in importing parts locally. Specifically around Nottingham, UK.
Where
---
Nottinghamshire, UK. https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/181040. (https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/181040)
Strictly within the bounds of this relation
The import will target built up zones such as residential areas, villages, and larger settlements.
It will not import any building that may overlap with one currently in the database, or that may duplicate anything currently within OSM.

What
---
Building footprints. I.e. building shapes in 2D.
It will not contain any tag data other than buidling:yes

Why
---
There are various places within Nottinghamshire that are without buildings. I would like to use this dataset to quickly add missing buildings into OSM.
I feel that it a more efficient use of my time to perform quality assurance on the imported data, rather than manually create the building footprints from aerial imagery myself.

Accuracy
---
It is a state-of-the-art machine learning database. This does not entail that the data should be entire trusted. I have visually examined cases around Nottingham to see how this dataset compares to both aerial imagery and current building in OSM. I feel that it is to a good quality, accurate, and does not have many false-positives within built up areas.
I will manually check and go through every area imported to ensure that the import is sane, looks like it should match with both aerial imagery, and with the OSM database with regards to road layout, and any buildings that may already be in OSM.

License
---
It uses the Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL). (https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/) This is compatible with the OSM license. Microsoft have a section in the Readme (https://github.com/microsoft/GlobalMLBuildingFootprints#should-we-import-the-data-into-openstreetmap) about importing into OSM.

The import process
---
The dataset in available within JOSM with the RapiD plugin. It provides an easy way to copy & import data from the dataset into the OSM database.
The import, if the proposal is accepted, will use a new user, whose purpose will be for this import project only. (username: ms-glftp-nottinghamshire)

My Questions
---
Has the Global ML Building Footprints been imported in another project? I have been unable to find any.

Are there other mailing lists I should reach out on to talk to the community about this?

Closing Remarks
---
I have not made an import before, but I am following the guidlines (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines) closely. I appreciate I may make mistakes, and look forward to working with the community on this.

Kind regards,
John

Subject: [Imports] Rio Branco (Brazil) addresses import
Message-ID: <SA1PR14MB5281F3DF08F1340A4A00B476E2D59@SA1PR14MB5281.namprd14.prod.outlook.com>

Hello all,

We checked that we can use data from the City of Rio Branco-Brazil (Public Domain with express consent), so we have plans to import addresses.

It's well documented on the wiki [1]. It is a quite extensive document with all the information needed to perform the import. We are prepared to start as soon as possible.

In short the city council provides a SHP of most addresses in the city. We did some tests and the data is good, but it will not be possible, in my understanding, a massive import without first processing the data. It is necessary attention and adjustments before uploading them to OSM.

We are basically cleaning and reviewing every address before uploading. Luckily, there are not many mapped address on OSM (less than a thousand), so we can conflate manually without much trouble.

A sample of converted and cleaned .osm file is available here [2].

Anyway, this was discussed and approved by some users in Brazilian community previously, and those responsible for this import (PlayzinhoAgro and I) have experience in imports and mapping. We've already made some cautious imports in Brazil, so I don't think there would be any problems in this one either.

Please let me know if you have any doubts!

Best regards,
Matheus

Hello!

You may wish to consider adding the MapWithAI plugin to your list of JOSM
plugins on the import page. I found its validation quite useful for my
address additions [1] for a similar United States dataset. In particular,
it has validation trying to match addr:street data with the names of
streets nearby. It ended up catching a decent amount of things that were
worth reviewing.

Message-ID: <BY3PR09MB7859D9BFA2BDA9C305977595E6D99@BY3PR09MB7859.namprd09.prod.outlook.com>

I am proposing importing all San Francisco addresses with their corresponding latitude and longitude, as served by DataSF at Addresses - Enterprise Addressing System<https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Addresses-Enterprise-Addressing-System/3mea-di5p> (https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Addresses-Enterprise-Addressing-System/3mea-di5p) as open data. Specifically, I am seeking to import the columns Address, Latitude, and Longitude. This is because not all San Francisco addresses are in OpenStreetMap, leading to unsuccessful matches when trying to retrieve missing addresses.

My concern is that many San Francisco addresses are already in OpenStreetMap, and there may be a conflict as to the Latitude and Longitude between those existing addresses and the San Francisco address data, leading to duplicate and mismatched data.

I note there is an OpenStreetMap wiki page San Francisco Address Import<https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Address_Import> (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Address_Import) which was last updated in 2020 and noted as ready for review. I?ve requested access to the review.

That said, we now presumably have three more years of data and would want to re-generate the review data.

Please advise. I am cross-posting this proposal to the Imports and Talk-US-SFBay mailing lists.


Hope this helps,

Hi Chas, good to see you on here.

The most important thing to note is that addresses should be applied to buildings and not as points. The "Materials (inputs, code, output)? link on the import page doesn?t work so I can?t see how they?re being applied.

Please let me know if you?d like any help with the application of house numbers to buildings in bulk as I?ve done this elsewhere.

An import that creates duplicate data must not happen.

The most obvious solution to this is to remove all addresses that are already in OSM from your import dataset. I.e. import only the missing addresses.
The process of finding existing addresses that are wrong (location,  name, number etc) and fixing them could be considered as a separate project.

The files linked from the wiki page are not publicly accessible (requires google login).  They probably should be made publicly readable.

Food for thought (I'm not local, so no opinions on what is right for you)
Does this imply that every building has at most one address?  An OSM object can't have more than one address.
How are units/apartments within multi-unit buildings addressed?

Buildings with multiple addresses use semicolons to separate their addresses in the field, like any field with multiple values.

Are there any buildings that have more than one addr:street in addresses
for that building? Or addr:unit numbers for different addr:housenumbers?
This happened for the Indianapolis data set. Delimiting works great until
you have to delimit more than one field. Maybe this doesn't happen in
practice in your area.

However, it's also nice to have addresses on nodes for buildings with
sizable footprints because you can then get the node closer to where the
address goes (ex: strip mall). I don't know how your dataset handles that.
The Indy dataset had addresses more or less where each tenant would be
located.

Thank you to everyone for your input. Alas, based on your comments, it appears the database I seek to use may not be a suitable choice for the intended purpose of an import to OpenStreetMap.

Chief issues are inconsistency as to where the lat/longs point to; difficulty automatically detecting buildings with more than one address per building, particularly if two street names are involved; and at least one case of a wildly inaccurate lat/long out of six lat/longs I looked at.

Details follow:

In response to people's various responses:

The building on the southeast corner of Market & Van Ness has three addresses: 1525 Market Street (the bank branch on the ground floor), 11 South Van Ness Avenue (the SFMTA Customer Service Center), and 1 South Van Ness Avenue (the office lobby on the first floor, as well as the entire basement and 2nd and higher floors, which are also above or below the bank branch and the SFMTA Customer Service Center) . 

In the City data from https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Addresses-Enterprise-Addressing-System/3mea-di5p:

1525 Market Street has lat/long of 37.77514082, -122.4189106. This points to the entrance.
1 South Van Ness Avenue has lat/long of 37.75385644, -122.4161123. Bad data. See below.
11 South Van Ness Avenue has lat/long of 37.77450185, -122.4188237. This points to the entrance.

Since the building is in the same place for each of these, it's clear that the lat/long does not refer to the building, but to the respective entrances. 

It appears that the lat/long given for 1 South Van Ness Avenue is wrong; Google Maps is giving me a location at South Van Ness and 23rd Street, over a mile away from the actual South Van Ness and Market. If we can't trust the data, then bulk importing is not going to work. (I've reported the 1 South Van Ness issue to the DataSF dataset owner.)

The building on the northwest corner of Geary and Presidio has at least four addresses, 949 Presidio Avenue, and 2620, 2630 and 2640 Geary. 949 Presidio is both behind and above the other addresses.

949 Presidio: 37.78312314, -122.4460813 points to the entrance.
2620 Geary is not in the data. I'm not necessarily concerned with missing addresses as they will at least do no harm.
2630 Geary: 37.78285206, -122.4463834 points to within the building.
2640 Geary: 37.78283298, -122.4465738 points to within the building.

I'm thinking that there might be a way to run a sanity check on lat/longs within a particular hundred block, for example that 1 South Van Ness is reasonably close to 11 South Van Ness (which in this case the data isn't even though the addresses are close in real life). San Francisco generally has 100 numbers per block counting from the beginning of the street. We might need to separate odd and even, as on the 700 block of Duboce.

That said, the inconsistency as to whether an entrance or a building is used sounds like it would be problematic with regard to OpenStreetMap's practices.

This would handle the simple case, if we have a way to detect it. Many buildings in San Francisco have more than one address. Two-unit houses will often have one address for each unit, for example 191 Example Street and 193 Example Street.

I didn't post that file. It was apparently posted to that page three years ago. I don't know why it might be protected. I've requested access and will update the list if I gain it.

Unit numbers that don't have unique street addresses beyond the unit number are outside of the scope I seek.

I believe the discrepancy has been overstated. While it?s true that 
buildings are often tagged with addresses, it?s very common for 
addresses to be mapped as standalone point features whenever they don?t 
correspond one-for-one to buildings, such as with duplex houses or 
downtown office blocks. Various imports in the U.S. have made exceptions 
for address points within condominiums, duplex houses, strip malls, and 
downtown office blocks.

For example, the building/address imports in nearby San Jos? [1] and 
Cupertino [2] even included sometimes very dense arrangements of address 
points for individual units within apartment complexes when available. 
This mapping style is also common inside retail buildings, since each 
address point might get upgraded a point of interest later on. We?re 
actively upgrading these points while manually mapping points of 
interest in Santa Clara County. [3] The address data we?re working with 
generally correlates to parcels or units, rather than entrances per se, 
but it could be different in the data you?re working with.

Conflating addresses that may or may not be tied to buildings can be 
more challenging. Popular QA tools like JOSM?s validator will warn 
whenever they detect multiple identical addresses within a certain 
distance. While this heuristic easily flags false positives in certain 
situations, it could still be a good starting point for planning your 
import.

I?ve reached out to the mappers who coordinated that original import, 
some of whom are still active in OSM. Hopefully you?ll be able to 
coordinate an update of this data with them. Down here in the South Bay, 
we?re going to need to update some of our older imports before long, so 
any solution you come up with could help us as well.

Hi Matt,

Thanks a lot! I checked it and it is indeed useful. I will add it to our workflow!

The style Coloured Streets are also useful, for some type of visual and quick validation as well (I recommend!).

Assunto: Re: [Imports] Rio Branco (Brazil) addresses import

Hello!

You may wish to consider adding the MapWithAI plugin to your list of JOSM plugins on the import page. I found its validation quite useful for my address additions [1] for a similar United States dataset. In particular, it has validation trying to match addr:street data with the names of streets nearby. It ended up catching a decent amount of things that were worth reviewing.

Hello all,

We checked that we can use data from the City of Rio Branco-Brazil (Public Domain with express consent), so we have plans to import addresses.

It's well documented on the wiki [1]. It is a quite extensive document with all the information needed to perform the import. We are prepared to start as soon as possible.

In short the city council provides a SHP of most addresses in the city. We did some tests and the data is good, but it will not be possible, in my understanding, a massive import without first processing the data. It is necessary attention and adjustments before uploading them to OSM.

We are basically cleaning and reviewing every address before uploading. Luckily, there are not many mapped address on OSM (less than a thousand), so we can conflate manually without much trouble.

A sample of converted and cleaned .osm file is available here [2].

Anyway, this was discussed and approved by some users in Brazilian community previously, and those responsible for this import (PlayzinhoAgro and I) have experience in imports and mapping. We've already made some cautious imports in Brazil, so I don't think there would be any problems in this one either.

Please let me know if you have any doubts!

Best regards,
Matheus

Hello Saeed,

Details of the deletion can be seen on changesets such as 
https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/119556694 .

The DWG received a complaint that this import was of particularly poor 
quality.? Various people tried to contact the imported, with no luck: 
http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/osm-discussion-comments?uid=11567 .

If you believe that this data (or perhaps some of this data) is of good 
enough quality to import, you'll need to follow the procedure at 
https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines , which includes 
making a case for the import (looking at licence, data quality, etc.) 
including messages to this list.

If you'd like to email the DWG about this ticket please email 
data at openstreetmap.org with a subject of "Re: [Ticket#2020112810000282] 
Yemen".

Best Regards,

Andy Townsend

(from the DWG, although not the DWG person actually dealing with this 
ticket)

All,

Names and acronyms can be confusing. Here is what I've learned:

The "GNS" acronym has also been used for imports from the GEOnet Names
Server run by the US government. As far as the wiki says, such imports are
legitimate. See https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/GEOnet_Names_Server

This import's dairy clearly says it was done from another "GNS" source -
Geonames.

There was another "GEOnet" service from ESRI. In 2012 it was renamed "ESRI
Community". See
https://community.esri.com/t5/community-blog/geonet-the-esri-community-name-change-to-esri/ba-p/1028806.

Hello ??Andy
Regarding these notes (which the community did not notice and the user did not send to the local community on Telegram or the mailing list), and his caused the loss of many points on the map that had existed for more than ten years and no one had complained about them!.
And if the community had been alerted about any note, it would have been possible to fix what needs to be fixed without the need for the huge and affecting deletion on the map!!!
As for the names, a point must be clarified, which is that we in Arab countries live in vast desert spaces And we name everything in it and it is documented and preserved even in ancient Arabic poetry, And we have many references for verification, and the names may be repeated a lot, for example (and this is a lot) a valley may be called after the type of trees spread in it, so you find the same name repeated 25 times in Saudi Arabia and in different regions, A village may be called by a specific name that has the same name as another village that is far away from it (this is confusing for contributors who are inexperienced with geographical names locally, so he searches for his village and discovers another, then deletes it or comments that it is incorrect!!) This applies to the user you mentioned:
https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/samams
http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/osm-discussion-comments?uid=6980925&commented

Where he removed the peak with the same name of his village, even though the place is correct and the name of the peak is correct, and there is no problem except that the name of the peak is similar to the name of his village!, Also he is very fanatical about his village to the point that he falsifies the population number and changes the classification frequently:
peak:
https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1237557680/history
the village:
https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/747667494/history

Another example of a user deleting a place because he wants no other village with the same name as his village to be on the map!:
https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/7650532028/history
https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/6775946496/history
https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/766523203/history

In conclusion, Mr. Hubaishan and I will re-import the GNS points and wil follow https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines and we will review them thoroughly before uploading them in order to avoid any errors.

my regards
Abdullah Abdulrhman

Subject: [Imports] Possible import of buildings in Antananarivo, Madagascar?
Message-ID: <CABzN_KLSk3NdWw5W=MvoFeynjKRAw2ZUtNUwvNmzJfza8B2-xQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello list,

I am possibly wrong, but there is likely an undiscussed import of buildings
happening in Antananarivo, Madagascar. Please see this changeset that I
commented and all previous and following changesets by the same user:
https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/133061376

What makes me think those buildings are from a certain source:

- They don't align with any of the imageries available on OSM editors, so
they were likely drawn from some third party imagery (although the source
tag of the changesets says Bing).

- The attribute table is consistent and all added buildings have the same
keys addr:suburb, addr:secteur, addr:lot, addr:housenumber, and addr:city

- The values of addr:lot=* are not valid house addresses like we use here
(As per the comment on https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/132331988 it
looks like it was initially added to OSM as addr:ilot but then changed to
addr:lot)

- Every house has addr:housenumber=* which is very rarely used here (only
in downtowns where streets are named). We use a lot-based address system
and I am not sure what these numbers on each building are supposed to
represent (even gas station canopies are numbered).

I put a comment on one of the changesets (first link) but haven't had a
response yet.

I hope I am wrong and this is not an import at all. And if this is an
import and has been discussed here but I missed it, sorry too.

Have a nice day!

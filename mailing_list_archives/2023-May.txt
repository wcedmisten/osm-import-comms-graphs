Subject: [Imports] US - HIDFL (DHS) Hospital Import
Message-ID: <CAGF1K-TUnzwvJb22EXkaq4UR5US8HLO5eOSGcZB7Uh=RYgYiiw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

My name is William Edmisten (wcedmisten). I've been mapping in OSM for
almost a year, but have no relevant affiliation with any other
organizations.

I am writing to propose an import of the HIDFL Hospital dataset
<https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/hospitals/explore>
(8,013 records), and to discuss possible ways in which this dataset could
be used.

I've documented some details about the Hospital dataset and how it might be
applied on this wiki page
<https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/HIFLD/Public_Health>.

Looking at the archives, the entire HIDFL dataset was previously discussed
here in October 2022, but I would like to specifically focus on the
Hospitals dataset. One of the previous concerns was that the scope of HIDFL
overall was too broad, so I would like to narrow the discussion to this
single dataset for now.

I believe this data is appropriate for OSM, and can be verified
independently of the dataset, making it a good choice for import or for
reference while mapping. In particular, hospitals' websites can be used to
verify most or all of the data aggregated here.

Another prior concern related to the license, which is stated as:
> None (Public Use). Users are advised to read the data set's metadata
thoroughly to understand appropriate use and data limitations.

I emailed the support team at HIFLD at hq.dhs.gov to clarify the terms of the
license, and they clarified that the data is indeed available freely for
public use.
> Thank you for your inquiry, William. The dataset you are referring to is
being provided for public use.

Chief Data Officer (OCDO)

Best,

William Edmisten (wcedmisten)

thanks for the time you spend on it.

addr:full : may I sugest an improved wording :
when I start reading this section, it looks like you are
going to import addr:full in addition to the others.
at the end you say you erase it.
suggestion : in addotion to addr:full, using the usaddress library 
parsed into addr:housenumber and addr:street,
after manually check, addr:housenumber addr:street are imported
if the parsing worked as expected, if not addr:full is imported

addr:state usually ? decide if you import it or not :)

zip4 appended to addr:postcode with a hyphen :
do this match does this correspond to local use ?

disused:amenity=hospital : i don't see the added value
to import disued hospital

beds : On conflict : it is common practice that an import never 
overwrites the values that a contributor has entered in osm.
maybe it would be better to do this kind of conflict management 
separately from the import, especially since nothing says that
the hospital site is more up to date than osm: sometimes yes,
sometimes no

healthcare=psychiatry -> healthcare:speciality=psychiatry ?
because for an hospital healthcare is set to hospital too
or keep empty
healthcare=rehabilitation : same issue

trauma: you ask : "Does being a certified trauma center
imply emergency=yes?"
I don't think so. trauma is very vague, post-traumatic stress
is probably not an emergency=yes (in the sense that it is not
a sudden event that occurs and will be resolved during the day,
it is rather a long-term accompaniment duration outside the emergency 
department even if the first crisis can probably lead to the emergency 
department to stabilize the patient and avoid danger to others
and to himself

Progress by State : it's already ongoing ?
may I ask to have the review before the import ?
not importing then receving/readding any review.

missing info : changeset tag, for ex:
comment=importing missing hospital from HIFLD
import=yes

Hello! (dropped the import group on my initial reply. sorry for the double
mail Marc!)

A few comments from my perspective as a US mapper.

A "trauma center" has a very specific meaning in the United States and it
is specifically about treating serious ailment and injury. (Ex:
https://www.ptsf.org/become-a-trauma-center/what-is-a-trauma-center/) The
lowest level trauma center PA certifies (
https://www.ptsf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PTSF-Adult-Level-IV-Standards-1.pdf)
would handle what OSM considers emergency=yes. Here's the certification
application for Washington state and the first question about services
(page 16
https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2022-02/530190.pdf?uid=6453161ed88ce)
is whether there's 24/7 emergency care available.

Addresses in the states very commonly have the "full" nine digit postcode
nnnnn-nnnn (https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1uwP) as well as addr:state.

Regarding addr:full and addr:state: I probably should have phrased that
better. These were useful for my own work using HIFDL as reference (but not
primary source), but would be redundant for an import.

> disused:amenity=hospital : i don't see the added value to import disued
hospital
I believe there is still value in adding disused hospitals, because they
can provide additional information about other features. For example, they
still imply `building=hospital`, and in some cases the building is still
used for other (outpatient) medical purposes, just not as a hospital
providing inpatient care.

> healthcare=psychiatry -> healthcare:speciality=psychiatry ?
> because for an hospital healthcare is set to hospital too
> or keep empty
> healthcare=rehabilitation : same issue
This could also use some clarification from the US community. Currently, my
proposal tags psychiatric hospitals as "amenity=hospital,
healthcare=hospital, healthcare:speciality=psychiatry". However, I feel
like psychiatric hospitals are a distinct category from regular hospitals.
Is there a better tagging scheme for this?

I also think there's some overlap between healthcare=rehabilitation and
social_facility=nursing_home. It would be good to clarify the distinction.

> Progress by State : it's already ongoing ?

> not importing then receving/readding any review.
I should probably move this to another section, since it's not really an
import. This is more of a mechanical edit where I'm manually using
individual hospitals' websites to verify the reference info from HIFDL.

Are these still required if an informative changeset comment is provided?
I was under the impression the info could be provided either in the
changeset or in these tags.

Import Guideline doesn't required it
https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines

but imho, it's a good pratice, this allow
user to find for ex the website of the source
with one clic in stead of going to the wiki,
search it, read the page, find the url and clic on it
the same for the url to the wiki

the import=yes tag is also very useful if someone wants to select 
imports (e.g. in osmcha) without having to write a rule detecting
the import word in all the languages of the world, which would
be impossible in practice, without counting all the possible 
formulations of comment=* without this word

in a practical way, with josm, put them in a notepad,
copy it once and in one click in the windows "uploading",
all tags are added as changeset tag

Regards,
Marc

As someone who has worked on a successful import, a word of caution:
doing an import is almost certainly 10x harder than anyone who hasn't
been all the way through it thinks.  I don't mean to discourage you, but
to calibrate expectations.

It's not formally part of the norms, but I think imports should be done
with code, basically a program that takes the OSM db as it is and the
import db and produces a set of proposed editing actions
(additions/conflations) and things to inspect (object in OSM but not in
import).  That can then be debugged before any changes are made.  It is
critical that it be automated so that it can be re-run with little
effort.

I wonder what quality checking you have done on the database.  An
example might be to look at a county and the contents of OSM vs the
contents of the DHS database, and check that that everything in the DHS
database that is in OSM matches, and that things not in OSM actually
exist.  This should be the output of the program I described in the
previous paragraph.

Greg

It appears, as I think Marc has pointed out, that you have already started
this import.  You need to get community buy-in *before* starting to
actually load data into OSM via an import.  If this is the case, please
stop the import until the community has had a chance to comment on your
proposal.

Also, I don't see this import listed in the Import Catalog:
https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Catalogue

You, and others who participate in the import, must use an account other
than their regular OSM account, e.g. for you that might be
wcedmisten_imports

I have some serious concerns about the likely quality of this dataset.  The
metadata says that the dataset was "geocoded", while
that can have different meanings, what it means here is likely that a list
of hospitals with addresses was fed to a computer program that matched them
up with an address (reference) database to obtain coordinates.  While this
seems simple, a lot can go wrong.  For example, a transposition of a digit
in a hospital's zip code can cause it to be placed 100's of miles away
from its true location.

Duplicates are another problem, I have checked a few hospitals in my local
area, and I have already found two sets of duplicates (cases where one
entity purchased another, and now they both show up in the dataset at
essentially the same location).

While the metadata says that the dataset was updated in January of 2023, I
don't think that means that a complete update was done, just that those
maintaining the data changed something at that time.  Thus, large parts of
this dataset could be out of date. Some of the validation dates (VAL_DATE)
are from 2013, 10 years ago! Also, the VAL_METHOD for many records is
listed simply as "IMAGERY", and while a large general hospital is probably
obvious from imagery, this is not necessarily true for a smaller facility.

I would like to see at least a sample of the data converted to the OSM
schema.

Hello William,

It appears that you are continuing with this import[0] even after Marc's
message and my message pointing out that you need to wait to get "community
buy-in" before proceeding with an import[1].  Further, you seem to be doing
so using your regular OSM username rather than an account dedicated to
imports as specified by the import guidelines[2].  I questioned the quality
of the HIFLD dataset, and it looks like you have added a hospital[0] near
where I live that no longer exists (or you could say exists under a
different name). You did add it as "disused", but that is not quite correct
as it has been purchased and renamed[3]. The facility with the new name,
Johnstown Heights Behavioral Health, is in the HIFLD dataset (with the same
address and number of beds), but has not been added to OSM as far as I can
tell.  I also noticed that you deleted the "Progress by State" section of
your wiki page, if you really have done some importing already, that
probably should be left in there, unless you - or someone else - has
reverted your edits.

Mike

Hello Mike!

Excellent catch on the renamed hospital. That's another good data point
about what to be cautious about in this set. GNIS has similar traps in the
various feature types and it can be hard to know until you start digging.

Could you expand on why you think the process currently being followed
counts as an import? There was similar confusion when I was asking about
National Address Database additions. I had said "import" in my initial mail
but the consensus seemed to be that so long as I was reviewing things as I
went, I had satisfied my obligation as a good community member.

Presuming William is following along with the diary entry (
https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/watmildon/diary/401371) in the wiki as
originally posted, my understanding is that's not an import. He's reviewing
each item and editing in the same way a MapRoulette mapper given a list of
websites and lat/long coordinates would. Mistakes will happen. The edits
aren't all perfect. But for example, we don't make MR folks have import
accounts so I don't know how to articulate the dividing line.

I am not sure what the process is after having read the wiki page for this
activity (other than how the fields in the HIFLD dataset are going to be
translated to OSM tags) .[0]
1) William's original email said "I am writing to propose an import..."
2) The wiki page he cites in his email states "The purpose of this page is
to document the import of the data in the Public Health category of the
HIFLD"[0]
3) William has added this activity to the "Import Catalogue" on the OSM
wiki[1] (perhaps at my suggestion - but if it isn't an import, it probably
should not be added to that page)

Regardless of whether this is an import or not, we should be very careful
when using this data because of the potential quality issues cited in my
first email.  Smaller facilities may be located in buildings that are not
obviously hospitals, and per the example I cited (and the wiki entry for
this activity), facilities are purchased, or otherwise change their names
quite frequently.

Hello! Apologies for the confusion.

I hope to distinguish two different projects which I may have conflated in
my initial Wiki page: 1) using HIFDL Hospitals as reference material, but
not primary source, to find missing hospitals in OSM and 2) the actual
import of the HIFDL Hospitals dataset, which would rely on HIFDL as the
primary source rather than as reference.

For this reason, I've moved the wiki page on my progress of 1) to my own
page [0].

I do not believe 1) constitutes an import, because it is only using the
dataset as reference to find missing POIs, but using objectively verifiable
sources (each hospitals' website), similar to the workflow of many
"armchair" mappers. I believe this is a widely accepted practice in the OSM
community.

For this same reason, I am not using an import account.

This also addresses the concern about duplicate entries, because I am
manually de-duplicating them with the latest correct entry (as determined
from the hospital website), rather than relying on a program to
intelligently sort out duplication within the dataset or with OSM.

To the point on VAL_DATE, I believe checking the hospital website mitigates
this issue also.

In the case mentioned above, I used this news article [1] announcing the
hospital closure as my primary source. As you said, there is now a new
owner, which can also be verified from their website [2]. I will make sure
to check for new owners with this approach going forward.

Hope this clarifies things,

Best,

William Edmisten (wcedmisten)

Are you therefore dropping the proposal for an import?  It seems that if
you are going to do all of this manually, there is no reason for an
import.

Your original email, and the wiki page that it cited, led me to believe
that you intended to do an import, and thus the rules for imports would
apply, and thus my comments.

You might consider going to each state and getting its current list of
licensed hospitals, this is what HIFLD does to build/maintain this
dataset.  This would avoid the issue of old data in the HIFLD dataset.

I would still like to propose an import. Manually going through the data
and each hospital's website is fine to find missing hospitals in OSM, but
it's less feasible for the full 8,000 records.

Based on the feedback in this thread, it sounds like we'll need to better
assess the quality of the data first. I've seen a previous approach of
comparing 100 random records to OSM and measuring the accuracy based on
that.
This would also require a separate wcedmisten_imports account.

I think this would still need to be a semi-automated import - where the
HIFLD data is used as primary source, but a human still verifies every
proposed change.

Addressing Greg's point about a fully automated script:

I'm a bit unclear how this would work in practice. I feel like there are so
many edge cases in OSM tagging styles that it would be quite difficult to
ensure the program handles everything appropriately without checking
everything.
Do you have any prior examples of successful fully automated import
programs that have been run?

This is why I'm only proposing a semi-automated import, just to have human
eyes on things.

Best,

William Edmisten (wcedmisten)

Hello,
I'm looking to import a Delikatesy Centrum - a Polish supermarket chain.
I obtained permission from the data owner by email to import data from
their website https://www.delikatesy.pl/sklepy. It's been discussed
within the Polish community and there is interest in it, few people
offered help with importing data:
https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/import-delikatesow-centrum/99385

We have 1478 supermarkets, 1181 of which are already in OSM, to those
that are already in OSM, we want to add opening hours.

Wiki page of the import with all the details:

Hello,

Thanks for spending time on it

for ppl not reading polski, an ugly translation

source tag on object : I don't see why an object created by a 
contributor and to which you add an opening time should have a source 
tag suggesting that the information comes from the POI.
add a changeset tag to describe that only your modification has the POI 
as its source
I'd also advise you to describe the few changeset tags you can use 
(comment, url to the wiki page, import=yes, etc.).

Regards,
Marc

Thanks for doing this, it seems to be (as far as I can see) OK from the license
side and may get us a bit closer to good shop coverage.

Can you upload this to OSM Wiki? Either as a new page or as a file?

(this will be more durable, Google Drive file can disappear for many reasons)
I worry a bit about low data resolution - in case of tricky situations it would be
better top open a note.

Achieving better OH translation quality would be especially useful for
future updates of opening hours (if their website has better quality for?
their own shop than OSM, what seems very likely)

File uploaded to the wiki. About the low data resolution, I suppose
you mean inaccurate coordinates? That's why we will be checking every
single shop before adding it to OSM and comparing with the address -
if some cases won't be clear of course we won't add those, and we can
leave a note instead.

Good afternoon everyone, I hope you are doing well.

I am writing to tell you that we want to perform the import of about 791 tree records of the University of Antioquia (Sede Medellin, Antioquia) to the OSM platform. These data were taken in 2017 in an Ecology course. The students and the professor in charge agree with the publication of the data.

You can review this information in this Wikipedia link<https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/index.php?title=ES:Colombia/Proyectos/Importaci%C3%B3n_de_%C3%A1rboles_de_la_Universidad_de_Antioquia&veaction=edit#Muestra_de_datos_a_importar>

Any questions or suggestions, I am attentive to answer them.


Thanks for your attention

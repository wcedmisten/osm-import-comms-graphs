Subject: [Imports] Share cycle ports import in Japan
Message-ID: <CAHfkPP8UOQtG0kbv71kwUwpHNFcdrjT9kKvMN9WePAGsbyq68g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm planning to import share cycle ports for one of the major networks in
Japan.

"Hello Cycling" is the name of the brand/network.
A list of the cycle ports is provided in GBFS format.
The type of license is a multi-license, including ODbL.

I made an announcement about this import to the OSM Japan community
(talk-ja ML and Slack channel),
and the wiki page has been reviewed.
https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Catalogue/GBFS_HelloCycling_Import

Any comments/suggestions to help refine the workflow and other portions of
the wiki page are appreciated.

Best regards,

Subject: [Imports] LINZ Data Import - Undersea features
Message-ID: <SY7P282MB41073D29FE3D8FA762CB680BF05AA@SY7P282MB4107.AUSP282.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hi all,

In New Zealand the LINZ data import has been slowly progressing for many years. It began in 2009 and has been discussed a few times on this mailing list. For more info see https://wiki.osm.org/LINZ

There are about 100 underwater place names that have not been imported yet. They would be tagged with name=* + seamark:type=sea_area + seamark:sea_area:category=*, which is well documented on the wiki (see https://wiki.osm.org/Key:seamark:sea_area:category). Nearly all of these features would have a wikidata=* tag since they are well known places, e.g. the ?Brothers Seamount?.

Some of these features are located in the South Pacific Ocean quite far away from the New Zealand mainland, so I thought this mailing list might be interested.

The wiki page has more info about other data layers from LINZ which are being slowly imported: https://wiki.osm.org/LINZ


Thanks,
Kyle

If two mappers disagreed where exactly a certain underwater feature was, 
how could that dispute be resolved? Are these names relating to 
geographical features or sunken objects so that they could - in theory 
and with the right diving equipment - be verified "on the ground"?

Or is the only means of verification "check LINZ / Wikidata / ..."?

Bye
Frederik

To clarify, yes these are all natural features, https://wiki.osm.org/Key:seamark:sea_area:category has a list of examples (such as an underwater shelf, an abyssal hill, a shoal, ...)

So anyone who is curious could use a bathymetry map or any map that shows the depth of the water. Or as you mentioned, they could refer to an external source. Another example is https://gebco.net<https://gebco.net/> which lists underwater geographical features.

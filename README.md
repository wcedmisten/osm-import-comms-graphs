# Motivation

A recent proposal for the OpenStreetMap community was to move the 
official communication channel for discussion data imports from 
a [mailing list](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/imports)
to the new-ish OSM forum powered by [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org).

As a part of considering this proposal, I'd like to examine how each
platform is used currently, in order to compare them.

To accomplish this, I scraped both the mailing list archives and the Discourse forum
for all content going back to the beginning of the year (2023-01-01).

Then, I formatted both datasets and tagged each topic by the relevant country the import
was discussing (or N/A for general talk).
